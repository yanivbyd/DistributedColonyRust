Parquet Schema for Colony Images Analytics
===========================================

Table Name: images.parquert

This document describes the schema of Parquet files generated by ingest_bi.py for colony images.
Each row represents a single image that was captured at a specific tick during the colony simulation.

Core Fields
-----------
- tick (integer): Simulation tick number when the image was captured
- file_name (string): Filename of the image file in format "TTTTTTT.png" where TTTTTTT is the zero-padded 7-digit tick number (e.g., "0000020.png" for tick 20)

Notes
-----
- The tick field is extracted from the filename by removing the ".png" extension and parsing as an integer
- Image files are stored in the output/bi/<colony_id>/images/ directory
- Images are PNG format files that show the colony state at a specific tick
- The file_name can be used to locate the corresponding image file in the images directory
- Images are named using zero-padded 7-digit tick numbers to ensure proper sorting (e.g., tick 20 becomes "0000020.png")
- All image files are copied from the source location (either local output/s3/distributed-colony/<colony_id>/images_shots/ or downloaded from S3) to output/bi/<colony_id>/images/ during ingestion
