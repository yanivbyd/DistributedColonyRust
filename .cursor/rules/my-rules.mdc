Write simple, easy-to-read code.
Avoid code repetition.
Keep changes minimal and aligned with the prompt.
Prioritize efficient yet readable code.
Always build after doing changes, make sure no errors or warnings.
Do not ask for changes, always apply without asking.
Logging error should be done via log_error.
Do not run the crates - only check if they build without errors/warnings.
No unit tests

## Code Architecture Guidelines
- **High-level functions** should focus on business logic and orchestration
- **Low-level details** (TCP connections, serialization, file I/O, error handling) should be abstracted into separate helper functions
- Functions should read like API calls, not implementation details
- Abstract low-level operations into reusable helper functions

## Rust-Specific Guidelines
- Use the log! macro for logging in Rust code instead of crate::log!
- Prefer using .expect over macros like log_expect for error handling
- Use imports to refer to types like TCPStream and Request rather than fully qualified names
- Import Request classes and refer to them by simple names instead of fully qualified shared::be_api::Request
- Main.rs should be thin and shard-related logic should be placed in shard utils or colony modules
- Always clean up compiler warnings in the code
- Prefer passing random number generator objects (rng) to helper functions and using the random range function consistently
- Place duplicate code and constants under the shared crate instead of copying code from one module to another
- Avoid using global counters or global state
- Include the region parameter when logging colony events in backend code
- Do not include the [COORD] or [BE] prefix in log lines
